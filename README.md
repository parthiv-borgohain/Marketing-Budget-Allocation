# Marketing-Budget-Allocation
Project as Part of Optimization-I coursework.

Allocating and optimizing marketing budget to different media channels like Print, TV, SEO, Social Media etc

## Introduction: 

Marketing budgets are a crucial aspect of a company's operations, taking up 11% of total company budgets as per a recent study by Duke University, Deloitte LLP, and the American Marketing Association. However, the effectiveness of marketing varies widely, with some companies cutting digital marketing spending due to ineffectiveness and others increasing ad spend after positive feedback in international markets. The aim of this project is to use linear programming to build a simple marketing budget allocation strategy.

## Our Goal:

The goal of this project is to recommend a budget allocation of $10M among several marketing mediums for our company. The ROI for each medium was given to us.

Three constraints imposed by our boss must be met when allocating the budget:

    1. The amount invested in print and TV should not be more than the amount spent on Facebook and Email.
    2. The total amount spent on social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter) should be at least twice of SEO and AdWords.
    3. The amount invested in each platform should not exceed $3M.

## Conclusion: 

The results of this project provided valuable insights into budget allocation strategies and the impact of incorrect ROI predictions. The proposed constraints ensure stability while allowing for growth and provide a framework for future optimization problems.
